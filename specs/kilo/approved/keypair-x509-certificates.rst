================================================
Keypair support for X509 public key certificates
================================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/keypair-x509-certificates

Introduction of X509 public key certificates keypair support in the Nova API.


Problem description
===================

Nova keypairs are mostly used by Linux guests to handle user authentication via
SSH public key authentication without incurring in the management and security
overhead that passwords require.

Public keys are provided to the guests as part of the metadata and included in
the guest configuration by tools like cloud-init.

Windows operating systems don't support natively SSH and thus authentication
requires the usage of passwords unless the image deployer chooses to include a
3rd party unsupported SSH service port, which implies incurring in potential
security and support issues.

Windows supports natively password-less authentication for WinRM by using X509
certificates, including PowerShell remoting.

X509 certificates are used by WinRM in a way which can be considered consistent
with the usage of SSH keys on Linux, as both are based on public / private
keypairs. This is limited by the lack of native availability of SSH on Windows.

Certificates can be generated by the user or by Nova (like for the SSH
keypair case). Self-signed certificates are accepted.

Use Cases
----------

End User will be able to connect to a Windows instance without requiring a
password.

Like for the SSH keypair case, the use has the choice to generate the
X509 certificate and pass the public X509 to Nova (recommended) or let Nova
generate and return the certificate including the private key.

Project Priority
-----------------

None


Proposed change
===============

While Nova currently supports SSH keypairs only, the API can be extended to
support x509 certificates, while maintaining full backwards compatibility.

The areas that require changes are:

* Nova API, to accept the certificate type as an option (defaulting to SSH if
  not provided)
* The nova.compute.api.KeypairAPI class to be able to generate and manage X509
  certificates beside the existing SSH case
* nova.objects.Keypair class to add a type property
* Related database migration
* Nova metadata API to support an additional x509 content in
  nova.api.metadata.base.InstanceMetadata()
* python-novaclient to add the optional keypair type option

Usage examples

Generating an x509 keypair via CLI and saving the private certificate locally
(in PKCS#12 format):

    nova keypair-add keypair1 --keypair-type x509

Importing an x509 public key certificate:

    nova keypair-add keypair1 --keypair-type x509 --pub-key \
    /path/to/PEM_encoded_public_certificate

The certificate type could be discovered by examining the content without
requiring the user to provide it explicitly.

For backwards compatibility, omitting the certificate type results in a SSH
certificate:

    nova keypair-add keypair2 --pub-key /path/to/SSH_pub_key

equivalent to:

    nova keypair-add keypair2 --keypair-type SSH --pub-key /path/to/SSH_pub_key

On the metadata side ssh keys and x509 keys are provided separately for
backwards compatibility:

"public_keys": {"keypair2": "ssh-rsa AAAAB3...cyJvOQ== Generated by Nova\n"},
"x509": {"keypair1": "MIIDaTC...ysk8w==\n"},

Server metadata schema does not need changes:
http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/nova/api/openstack/compute/schemas/v3/server_metadata.py

Alternatives
------------

We are not worrying about the WinRM service certificate, as tools like
cloudbase-init can generate a self signed certificate that works in a similar
way to ssh host keys. Ideally the client would be told what certificate it
needs to trust, but this will be left until we do the same for ssh host keys.

Data model impact
-----------------

nova.objects.Keypair requires an additional string (VARCHAR(20)) type property,
named "Type". Initial possible values will be:

"ssh"
"x509"

Default value during database migration will be "ssh".

REST API impact
---------------

An optional extension named "os-extended-keypairs" will be added to
"/v2/{tenant_id}/os-keypairs" providing the following:

GET /v2/{tenant_id}/os-keypairs

Will include in the response dictionary the key type "key_type".

If the "os-extended-keypairs" extension is not present, only SSH keypairs will
be returned.

POST /v2/{tenant_id}/os-keypairs

Will include an optional parameter "key_type" (xsd:string), with possible
values "SSH" and "X509", default value "SSH".

The keypair schema definition will include "key_type" as well:

::

  create = {
      'type': 'object',
      'properties': {
          'keypair': {
              'type': 'object',
              'properties': {
                  'name': parameter_types.name,
                  'public_key': {'type': 'string'},
                  'key_type': {'type': 'string'},
              },
              'required': ['name'],
              'additionalProperties': False,
          },
      },
      'required': ['keypair'],
      'additionalProperties': False,
  }

  server_create = {
      'key_name': parameter_types.name,
  }

Work Items
----------

* Nova feature implementation
* python-novaclient support

Dependencies
============

* The guest will need to employ an agent able to retrieve the certificates from
  the metadata and import them. Cloudbase-Init >= 0.9.6 is already supporting
  x509 certificates.

Testing
=======

* CI testing will be performed by the Hyper-V CI.
* Tempest tests will be developed for this feature.

Documentation Impact
====================

The Nova driver documentation for nova keypair API and CLI commands usage need
to be updated.
