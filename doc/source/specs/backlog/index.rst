===========================
Nova Backlog Specifications
===========================

The Nova spec backlog is a place for the team to record decisions
about technical problems and proposed solutions. A backlog spec should
contain at least a clear problem description, as well as a general
description of the proposed or desired solution. This serves as a
marker to record the team's acceptance of a problem as in-scope for
the project, as well as a reasonable direction for solving the problem.

A spec that exists here is something that either needs a driver or
implementor, or something that can't be done currently. If you would
like to implement one of these specifications, fill out the missing
sections and follow the standard process of submitting it to a release
(See :doc:`../../readme`).
